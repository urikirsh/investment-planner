# AGENTS.md

Project-level guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Workflow Rules

- Never commit directly to `main`.
- If the current branch is `main`, create and switch to a new feature branch before making changes.
- Always work on a feature branch.
- Before the first commit on a newly created branch, if version files are touched, verify whether the version bump is major, minor, or patch and apply that decision consistently.
- Commit only files touched for the requested task.
- Do not include unrelated local artifacts in commits.
- Keep commits single-purpose (for example: `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`) and avoid mixing unrelated categories.

## Required Validation After Every Code Change

Run both checks after every code change, using the project config in `pyproject.toml`:

- `py -3.13 -m mypy --config-file pyproject.toml`
- `py -3.13 -m pytest -c pyproject.toml`

Do not report completion if either command fails.

## Interpreter And Test Execution

- Use the same Python interpreter pattern as the project commands (`py -3.13`) when running tests and type checks.
- Prefer explicit config-driven invocations over implicit defaults so local/global tooling differences do not affect results.
- If you run targeted tests while iterating, still run the full required validation commands before completion.

## Testing Conventions

- Put tests in the matching module area:
  - core/domain logic -> `tests/core`
  - UI behavior -> `tests/ui`
- Reuse shared test utilities/helpers as much as possible before adding new test scaffolding.
- Shared test utility locations in this repo:
  - Core tests: `tests/core/helpers.py` (payload/model builders like `make_valid_data`, `make_portfolio`)
  - UI tests: `tests/ui/conftest.py` (shared fixtures/builders like `qapp`, `make_plan_step`, `make_buy_calculation`)
- Always accompany new code with new tests, and update existing tests when behavior/contracts change.

## Documentation Maintenance

- If any file is added or deleted, update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` in the same task to reflect the structural change.
- If user-facing behavior changes, update `README.md` in the same task.
- Keep `README.md` user-facing; put implementation details in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- In `README.md`, describe user outcomes and avoid implementation-specific details unless explicitly requested (for example: internal state flags, cache tiers, thread/worker lifecycle, or exact dialog button labels).
- Prefer documenting behavior contracts over implementation details so docs remain stable across refactors.
- Keep documentation concise and behavior-accurate; avoid broad background text when a precise statement is enough.
- Be strict with absolutes in user-facing docs: verify `always` / `never` / `only` claims against current runtime paths before finishing.
- Keep architecture/docs granularity symmetric: avoid over-documenting one field/module unless peers are documented at the same level or the exception is intentional.
- When changing user-facing text (UI labels/messages/docs), verify wording matches runtime behavior and units.

## Review Quality Rules

- For branch reviews, review changes relative to the branch merge-base with `main`.
- Use `main...HEAD` (merge-base diff), not latest-commit diffs, for branch-level review scope.
- After fixing review findings, do a quick follow-up self-review of touched areas before handing off.
- For documentation-only changes, verify claims map to current code paths and avoid redundant repetition.

## Refactor And Consistency Rules

- Prefer enum-driven behavior over hardcoded member checks (for example, use `exchange.currency` instead of branching on specific exchange names).
- Use shared defaults/constants for fallbacks (for example, `DEFAULT_EXCHANGE`) instead of inline string literals.
- For schema or field renames, update all affected layers in the same task: model, JSON IO, validation, UI labels/tooltips, tests, and docs.
- After intentional breaking changes, remove stale "legacy" compatibility wording unless backward compatibility is still implemented.
- When introducing a canonical public API, migrate callers in the same task and remove or privatize legacy setters unless an explicit migration window is required.
- Remove stale no-op seams once behavior has stabilized; do not keep indefinite compatibility wrappers with no runtime effect.
- When removing a seam/wrapper, also remove stale protocol members and seam-specific tests in the same task.
- In PowerShell commands, avoid Bash-only chaining like `&&`; use separate commands or `;`.

## PR Writing

- When asked for a PR title and description, provide a short description written in Markdown.

## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.
### Available skills
- ask-questions-if-underspecified: Ask focused clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous before implementing changes. (file: C:/Users/kirst/AppData/Local/JetBrains/PyCharm2025.3/aia/codex/skills/ask-questions-if-underspecified/SKILL.md)

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/kirst/AppData/Local/JetBrains/PyCharm2025.3/aia/codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.
